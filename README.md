DESCRIPTION:

Project Description: Chatbot Using Natural Language Processing
This project focuses on developing a simple rule-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK and Rich in Python. The chatbot is designed to understand user queries and provide appropriate responses based on predefined intents.

Key Features:
Basic Conversation Handling – The chatbot can recognize and respond to greetings, farewells, and expressions of gratitude.
Query-Based Responses – It can provide useful links for weather updates, live sports scores (cricket and football), and chatbot-related information.
Project & Assignment Assistance – The chatbot can guide users by providing ideas and insights for their projects, tasks, or assignments.
Capability Awareness – Users can ask about the chatbot's abilities, and it will describe its features and available functionalities.
Interactive Console Output – The chatbot utilizes the Rich library to display responses in a visually appealing way, including clickable hyperlinks.
Intent Detection Using Tokenization – The chatbot uses word tokenization to analyze user input and determine the correct response based on keyword matching.
Working Mechanism:
When a user inputs a query, the chatbot tokenizes the text and identifies keywords.
Based on the detected intent, it selects an appropriate response from predefined options.
If the input matches a recognized query, the chatbot either provides a direct response or a relevant hyperlink.
If the input is unrecognized, it prompts the user to clarify their question.
Applications:
Basic customer support and FAQs.
Information retrieval for specific topics (e.g., weather, sports).
Personal assistants for academic guidance.
Learning and experimenting with NLP concepts.
